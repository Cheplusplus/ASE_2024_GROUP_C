MongoDB notes
1. No sequal database- We do not use sequal commands to interact with it.
Sequal data- a data with a relation, be it tables, graphs, rows etc
But MongoDB uses collections of documents(thus allows for easier handling of unstructured data and faster queries) and stores them in a flexible JSON-like format called BSON(binary JSON)

Practical Example:
Imagine youâ€™re building a blog. In MongoDB, you might have a collection called posts. Each blog post can be stored as a document with different fields, like:

{
  "title": "My First Blog Post",
  "content": "This is the content of my first blog post.",
  "author": "Mmakgosana",
  "tags": ["mongodb", "blog", "first post"],
  "created_at": "2024-10-22T12:00:00Z"
}
